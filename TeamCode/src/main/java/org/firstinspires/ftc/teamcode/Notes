why in Drivetrain.getPose all the variables are final?? isn't it supposed to be not-final so the pos could update?
in several places fyou mentioned Drivetrain as Drivetrain while in others you mentioned it as DriveTrain... how would you like it to be called? (DriveTrain in my opinion)
here is a list of things I am not sure that is gonna help us :
- GlobalData class
- DrivetrainHardware class
-Drivetrain.reset
-IntakeHardware class
-Intake.reset
-SubsystemManager functions (I can see the use for the class but I am quite sure the function are incorrect)
